Explanations of Specific Technologies: 
-Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM on VS Code.

Approach Taken: 
-First, I wrote out the game in pseudocode to detail how I wanted the game to function. 
-Then, I decided to build the scripts necessary for the game to function. I built the scripts into each HTML page that required it. 
-Finally, I added styles to the index and other HTML files. 

Unsolved Problems: 
-Minor styling issues.

Link to Hosted Site: 
https://wendyvosu.github.io/number-guessing-game/

Installation Instructions: 
-There is no installation necessary to play the game. The user may access the game through the "Link to Hosted Site".

Technical Details: 
-The script of the game uses four separate functions: checking the user's guess, checking the computer's guess, ending the game, and resetting the game. 

Technical Challenges: 
-Preventing page refreshing once the functions have passed. 

Future Improvements: 
-Modify the script so that the user is restricted from guessing numbers which fall out of the possible range of the number. 
-Modify the script so that the computer is unable to make the same guess multiple times by using an array. 
-Additional styling adjustments.
